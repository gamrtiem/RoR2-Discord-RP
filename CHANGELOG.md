  - This mod's EOS support is still in testing, please let me know if you encounter any game- or mod-breaking issues
  - If you still encounter issues with multiplayer, please make sure you are signed into your Epic Games account if you have enabled crossplay -- this is not a mod issue!

- Fixed an issue where the user could still receive join requests and send game invites after the run has started
